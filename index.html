<h1>PRASANNA KONAKANCHI</h1>
<h6>MY FAVORITE PLACE TO VISIT</h6>
<p> The place I like to buy food in Hyderabad is Gajalee. It’s a small store near my home which is always crowded with people. 
    It has a huge variety of Indian dishes and some international dishes as well.    
     2- Some other places near my home are: <b> 1) Moti Mahal 2) Gol Market </b> 3) Malabar Biryani 4) Pappu’s 5) Anjappar 6) Biryani.
     Some other places near Hyderabad are Lalbagh Fort, Chowmahalla Palace, Charminar Mosque, Qutub Minar Complex</p>

     <h2> ROUTE</h2>
     <p>
        The airport that is closest to your food location in Hyderabad is the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport.

        The airport is located at a distance of about 20 kilometers from the city center and it is served by 4 airlines. It has been in operation since 2010 and it has a capacity of 2.5 million passengers per year.
        
        The airport has 3 terminals, with Terminal 1 being the largest of them all..
        The steps for traveling to your food location from the airport in Hyderabad are as follows:<ol>
            <li>Take a cab to the nearest metro station. The closest metro station is called Nampally. It is located at a distance of 3 kilometers from the airport.</li>
            <li>Take the metro train to Kukatpally and then take another bus or cab to your destination, which will take approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes. The fare will cost you around Rs 200-300 per person, depending on how many people are traveling with you.</li>
            
          </ol>  
          List of foods items i would recommend for others from my location:

          <ul>
            <li>Baguette</li>
            <li>Bagels</li>
            <li>Bread</li>
            <li>Brownies</li>
            <li>Butter</li>

          <h2>Games</h2>
          <hr>

          <p>There are so many activities that one can try that it is difficult to narrow down the list. However, some sports and activities are more popular than others. For example, people who have tried yoga might be more likely to recommend it to someone else than someone who has not tried yoga before.

            The following sports and activities are some of the most popular ones:</p>
          <table>

    <h1> Disjoint Set Data Structures</h1>
    <blockquote> What is Disjoint-set data structure?

        Represents a mathematics concept Set.
        A disjoint-set data structure, also called a union–find data structure or merge–find set.
        A disjoint-set data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint or non-overlapping subsets.
        It provides near-constant-time operations to add new sets, to merge existing sets, and to determine whether elements are in the same set.
        Plays a key role in Kruskal’s algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.
        This can also be used to detect cycle in the graph.
        How Disjoint Set is constructed:
        
        A disjoint-set forest consists of a number of elements each of which stores an id, a parent pointer
        The parent pointers of elements are arranged to form one or more trees, each representing a set.
        If an element’s parent pointer points to no other element, then the element is the root of a tree and is the representative member of its set.
        A set may consist of only a single element. However, if the element has a parent, the element is part of whatever set is identified by following the chain of parents upwards until a representative element (one without a parent) is reached at the root of the tree.Disjoint Set Operations:
        
        MakeSet(X): This operation makes a new set by creating a new element with a parent pointer to itself. The parent pointer to itself indicates that the element is the representative member of its own set. The MakeSet operation has O(1) time complexity.
        
        Find(X): follows the chain of parent pointers from x upwards through the tree until an element is reached whose parent is itself. This element is the root of the tree and is the representative member of the set to which x belongs, and may be x itself.
        
        Union(x,y): Uses Find to determine the roots of the trees x and y belong to. If the roots are distinct, the trees are combined by attaching the root of one to the root of the other. If this is done naively, such as by always making x a child of y, the height of the trees can grow as O(n).

    <pre> 
        function Union(x, y)
   xRoot := Find(x)
   yRoot := Find(y)
 
   // x and y are already in the same set
   if xRoot == yRoot            
       return
   
   // x and y are not in same set, so we merge them
    if xRoot.rank < yRoot.rank 
      xRoot.parent := yRoot 
    else if xRoot.rank > yRoot.rank
      yRoot.parent := xRoot
   else
     xRoot.parent := yRoot
     yRoot.rank   := yRoot.rank + 1

\\ Path compression: 

function Find(x)
   if x.parent != x
     x.parent := Find(x.parent)
   return x.parent
\\ MakeSet
 function MakeSet(x)
   if x is not already present:
     add x to the disjoint-set tree
     x.parent := x
     x.rank   := 0
