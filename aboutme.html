  <h2> MY FAVORITE MOVIE </h2>
  <p>
    There are so many different types of movies, and people like them for different reasons. That being said, I think the movie that I like most is a movie called "The Shawshank Redemption." It's about this man named Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully imprisoned and after spending over 20 years in prison he finally gets out.
 Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film that tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his wife and her lover.

The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most popular movies ever made. It has been critically acclaimed for its acting, screenplay and directing. It has also been ranked as the best movie on Rotten Tomatoes with a 98% rating from critics and an average rating of 9.3/10 from audiences.

I like The Shawshank Redemption because it's filled with suspense, humor, and heartwarming moments that make it one of my favorite movies to watch over and over again.
